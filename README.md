# Okkei Patcher
**Okkei Patcher** is a simple tool for localizing the Android version of CHAOS;CHILD.
It downloads the latest revision of CHAOS;CHILD Android English patch and automatically applies it to the installed Japanese version.
It creates a backup of your original installation of CHAOS;CHILD as well. You can check a checkbox whether you want to backup/restore your save data.
It is not planned to update the English patch. If you improved my English patch in some way, please contact me so I can upload it if it's compatible with Okkei Pather.

It is not recommended to run Okkei Patcher on weak, low-budget or very old devices.
Okkei Patcher supports devices running Android from version 5.0 Lollipop and above with armeabi-v7a (though it is not tested on older versions of Android, it was tested on Android Oreo and Android 10).
It is recommended to not uninstall Okkei Patcher until you decide to uninstall CHAOS;CHILD completely, for your convenient user experience.
